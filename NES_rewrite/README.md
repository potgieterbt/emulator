I am rewriting the NES emulator due to running into issues of my previous attempt's archetecture.
I am now writing it from "scratch" by using the [NES test ROMs](https://github.com/christopherpow/nes-test-roms), attempting to run each rom and fix each bug as it occurs until the emulator runs well enough before I need to add edge cases from the nesdev wiki.
